or read the assignment here 


In a file called `indoor.py`, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a `str` of your own as an argument to `input`.

Hints: 
- Recall that `input` returns a `str`. 
- Recall that a `str`comes with quite a few methods.


Test Cases:
- Run your program with `python indoor.py`. Type `HELLO` and press Enter. Your program should output `hello`.
- Run your program with `python indoor.py`. Type `THIS IS CS50` and press Enter. Your program should output `this is cs50`.
- Run your program with `python indoor.py`. Type `50` and press Enter. Your program should output `50`.
