In a file called `faces.py`, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input with any `:)` converted to 🙂 and any `:(` converted to 🙁. All other text should be returned unchanged.

    `Hello 🙂`
    
- Run your program with `python faces.py`. Type `Goodbye :(` and press Enter. Your program should output:
    
    `Goodbye 🙁`
    
- Run your program with `python faces.py`. Type `Hello :) Goodbye :(` and press Enter. Your program should output
    
    `Hello 🙂 Goodbye 🙁`
