In a file called `playback.py`, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with `...` (i.e., three periods).



Test Cases:
- Run your program with `python playback.py`. Type `This is CS50` and press Enter. Your program should output: 
            `This...is...CS50`
    
- Run your program with `python playback.py`. Type `This is our week on functions` and press Enter. Your program should output: 
            `This...is...our...week...on...functions`
    
- Run your program with `python playback.py`. Type `Let's implement a function called hello` and press Enter. Your program should output
            `Let's...implement...a...function...called...hello`
